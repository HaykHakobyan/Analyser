INSTALLING GIT ON UBUNTU

First you must create a free account in http://github.com. You also need a ssh
key to connect to Git server, and instructions can be found in
http://help.github.com/linux-key-setup/. Then in a terminal type:

        $ sudo aptitude install git-core


This install the git command line to manage your repositories. You must
configure your setting:

        $ git config --global user.name YOUR_USERNAME
        $ git config --global user.email YOUR_MAIL


Also it is recommended to set this, for dealing with line endings:

        $ git config --global core.autocrlf input


Now you can clone the Data_analisys repository. But first you must be added as
collaborator, or you will not be able to push your changes. Go to your project
path and type

        $ git clone git@github.com:smancill/Data_analysis.git


or if you prefer to change the directory name

        $ git clone git@github.com:smancill/Data_analysis.git DIRECTORY_NAME


Now you have a copy of the project in your local repo, and you can work with
it. If you need help, you can see
